Fixed pathfinding to actually work now. Implemented fog of war for both NPCs and player but not ability for player to memorise structures outside his field of view.
Performance dropped slightly and screen refreshing is visible. Possible weird angle of visibility.

Implemented pathfinding algorithm that NPCs use when they get aggresive(only possible towards player for now and via F1 button).
All live targets now have move speed variable which will affect how fast they can move(not yet implemented for pathfinding).
Resolved bug that allowed two Live Targets to exist on the same tile.

All player constructable(later possible) tiles now identified as structures(no changes to how maps are loaded from textfiles). Structures are now displayed after current map level.
Distance is now changeable. Console size now tries to fullscreen every time you load the game. All movement and interactions are now mostly handled against structures at that location
(instead of map itself).Tiles can now change types(instead of creating a new tile and destroying everything on the existing). Console tile now actually interacts with structure
on which its located.
